# A 2-wheeled voice controlled Robocar

- Here, 2 motors, each for 1 wheel, have been used for the movements of the car: front, right, left and back. The Arduino code maps the required movement to the motor pin numbers and the action to be taken based on the input detected in the form of speech.

- MIT App Inventor was used to create a makeshift Android application in which we can simply tap on the mic to give our input in the form of speech and the robocar will move according to what we say, for eg., "left" "right" "forward" "back".

#### The images in the repo have been used as icons/ buttons inside the app.
